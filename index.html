        <h2>Why Charleston?</h2>
        <h3>Beaches, Trails, and Parks</h3>
        <p>
            Charleston and surrounding areas have a ton to offer for dog adventuring. There are plenty of public beaches, county parks, trails, and even dining that welcome dogs. Make sure you research each place before you go just to make sure it is a good environment for you and your dog. It is also smart to look up and understand any rules they may have in regard to dogs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Always keep poop bags on you to clean up after your dog, and bring water if you plan on making a day out and about. Most places aside from dog parks will require you to keep your dog on a leash. Fleas and ticks are common in the lowcountry, so having your dog on preventative is not a bad idea. Charleston is an amazing dog-destination, be responsible with your pets and have fun!

<h4>Folly Beach</h4>
<p>Folly Beach is a great place to take your dog to play in the water, the sand, walk around the shops and cafes, and there is even a little park with a fishing pier (not the main pier) that you can walk your leashed dogs on. There are rules for dog access based on the time of year, be sure to check the rules beforehand.</p>

<h4>Johns Island County Park</h4>
<p>Johns Island County Park has a more rural feel. Nestled under the oak trees and Spanish moss, there are tons of trails to get lost for a while or if you prefer, an off-leash dog park (this dog park is gator-free!)</p>
